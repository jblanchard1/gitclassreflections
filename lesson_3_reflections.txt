When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you need to share your work, either with other people, or between multiple devices to keep your work accessible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If others edit your code, you may not know about them if you do not pull automatically.
