I skipped the first question

Second questions: Why do you think some version control systems, like 
Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file seperately?

I would assume most people don't use Google Docs for collections of 
files or coding. Most people would like to edit one file at a time, that 
is unrelated to any other file.

-- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history 
of files?

Run git log to get a list of commits, then git diff on the ids of two 
particular commits to see the changes.
