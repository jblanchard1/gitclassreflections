Reflections on lesson 2 of the Git course

--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it adds the hidden ".git" file which 
will be used to track commits. It doesn't create a commit, though. You 
have to do that yourself.


--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The opportunity to change your mind. Staging area is either a reference 
to the document at the current point or a copy of the document at the 
current point.


--How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

You can run git diff --staged after adding everything to the staging 
area to see what the commit changes from the most recent commit.

--What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches can help you if you want to create another version of your 
program without changing the main version. It would let you switch 
between versions without worrying about messing up the other one.
