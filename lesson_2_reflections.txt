Reflections on lesson 2 of the Git course

--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, it adds the hidden ".git" file which 
will be used to track commits. It doesn't create a commit, though. You 
have to do that yourself.


--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The opportunity to change your mind. Staging area is either a reference 
to the document at the current point or a copy of the document at the 
current point.
